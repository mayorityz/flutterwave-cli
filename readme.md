An unofficial CLI -tool for flutterwave

I am currently leaving out "create" parts of the tool for now!

#issues

1. fetch transactions returns all the readings, even when the from n to dates are specified.

2. the creation of subaccounts from the terminal doesn't verify the account numbers... and as a result cannot create and account.

3. the docx say you are passing tx_ref to verify a transaction, but it actually uses the id

#todo

- add tables to some response e.g. fetch all v. cards
- add next to navigate responses in the terminal
